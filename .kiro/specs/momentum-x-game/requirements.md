# Requirements Document

## Introduction

Momentum X is a cyberpunk-themed 3D endless runner game inspired by Temple Run, where players navigate through a futuristic cityscape while manipulating time to survive increasingly difficult obstacles. The game combines traditional endless runner mechanics (running, jumping, sliding, turning) with unique time powers (freeze, slow, speed up) that affect gameplay mechanics differently, creating strategic depth and multiple ways to overcome challenges. Built with Three.js and vanilla JavaScript, the game targets web browsers and emphasizes smooth 60fps performance with procedural difficulty scaling.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a player, I want to control a character that runs automatically through a 3D cyberpunk cityscape with traditional endless runner controls, so that I can navigate obstacles using both movement and time powers strategically.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the game starts THEN the player character SHALL move automatically forward at a consistent base speed through a 3D environment
2. WHEN the player presses Space THEN the game SHALL start from the main menu
3. WHEN the player presses Up Arrow or W THEN the character SHALL jump over low obstacles
4. WHEN the player presses Down Arrow or S THEN the character SHALL slide under high obstacles
5. WHEN the player presses Left Arrow or A THEN the character SHALL move to the left lane
6. WHEN the player presses Right Arrow or D THEN the character SHALL move to the right lane
7. WHEN the player collides with any obstacle THEN the game SHALL end immediately and display a game over screen
8. WHEN the game is over THEN the player SHALL be able to restart by pressing R

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a player, I want three distinct time manipulation powers with different effects and cooldowns that work alongside traditional movement, so that I can strategically choose between dodging physically or using time powers in different situations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the player presses F AND freeze power is not on cooldown THEN the game SHALL freeze all obstacles and environmental movement for 2 seconds with a 5-second cooldown
2. WHEN the player presses Q AND slow power is not on cooldown THEN the game SHALL reduce all game element speeds by 50% for 3 seconds with a 4-second cooldown
3. WHEN the player presses E AND speed power is not on cooldown THEN the game SHALL double all game speeds for 1.5 seconds AND double the score rate with a 6-second cooldown
4. WHEN a power is on cooldown THEN the system SHALL prevent activation and display the remaining cooldown time
5. WHEN a power is active THEN the system SHALL provide visual feedback indicating which power is currently active
6. WHEN time powers are active THEN player movement controls SHALL remain fully responsive

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a player, I want to encounter various 3D obstacles that can be avoided through movement or time manipulation, so that I have multiple strategic options for overcoming challenges.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN obstacles spawn THEN the system SHALL randomly select from barriers (jump over), low walls (slide under), side barriers (move left/right), and moving hazards
2. WHEN obstacles spawn THEN they SHALL be positioned across three lanes (left, center, right) with appropriate spacing
3. WHEN freeze time is active THEN all obstacles and environmental movement SHALL stop completely
4. WHEN slow time is active THEN all obstacles SHALL move at 50% of their normal speed
5. WHEN speed time is active THEN all obstacles SHALL move at 200% of their normal speed
6. WHEN the player successfully avoids an obstacle THEN the system SHALL award 5 points
7. WHEN obstacles are placed THEN they SHALL allow for both movement-based and time-power-based solutions

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a player, I want a scoring system that rewards both survival time and obstacle avoidance, so that I have multiple ways to achieve high scores.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the game is running THEN the system SHALL award 1 point per second of survival
2. WHEN the player successfully passes an obstacle THEN the system SHALL award 5 points
3. WHEN speed time power is active THEN the system SHALL double the rate of all score gains
4. WHEN the game ends THEN the system SHALL display the final score prominently
5. WHEN the score changes THEN the system SHALL update the display in real-time

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a player, I want the game difficulty to increase progressively over time, so that the challenge remains engaging as I improve.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN 20 seconds have elapsed THEN the system SHALL increase the difficulty level by 1
2. WHEN difficulty increases THEN obstacle spawn rate SHALL increase (minimum 0.5 seconds between spawns)
3. WHEN difficulty increases THEN obstacle movement speed SHALL increase by 0.2x per level
4. WHEN difficulty increases THEN the system SHALL maintain smooth 60fps performance
5. IF the game has been running for multiple difficulty cycles THEN the system SHALL continue scaling appropriately

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a player, I want an immersive 3D cyberpunk visual experience with dynamic environments, so that the game feels modern and engaging.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the game is running THEN the system SHALL display a 3D cyberpunk cityscape with buildings, neon lights, and atmospheric effects
2. WHEN the player moves THEN the 3D environment SHALL scroll smoothly with appropriate perspective
3. WHEN time powers are active THEN environmental movement and particle effects SHALL adjust accordingly
4. WHEN the game renders THEN the system SHALL maintain 60fps performance using Three.js optimization techniques
5. WHEN visual elements are displayed THEN they SHALL follow a consistent cyberpunk aesthetic with neon colors and futuristic architecture
6. WHEN the player changes lanes THEN the camera SHALL smoothly follow the movement
7. WHEN obstacles approach THEN they SHALL have appropriate 3D depth and lighting effects

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a player, I want a clear HUD that shows my score and power cooldowns, so that I can make informed decisions about when to use my abilities.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the game is running THEN the system SHALL display the current score in the top-left corner
2. WHEN the game is running THEN the system SHALL display three power cooldown bars in the top-right corner
3. WHEN a power is on cooldown THEN the corresponding bar SHALL show the remaining time visually
4. WHEN a power is available THEN the corresponding bar SHALL indicate readiness clearly
5. WHEN the HUD updates THEN the system SHALL use smooth animations for visual feedback

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a player, I want smooth 3D lane-based movement that feels responsive and intuitive, so that I can quickly navigate between lanes while maintaining forward momentum.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the game starts THEN the player SHALL be positioned in the center lane of a three-lane track
2. WHEN the player presses left movement keys THEN the character SHALL smoothly transition to the left lane over 0.3 seconds
3. WHEN the player presses right movement keys THEN the character SHALL smoothly transition to the right lane over 0.3 seconds
4. WHEN the player is already in the leftmost lane AND presses left THEN no movement SHALL occur
5. WHEN the player is already in the rightmost lane AND presses right THEN no movement SHALL occur
6. WHEN the player is transitioning between lanes THEN they SHALL still be able to jump and slide
7. WHEN lane transitions occur THEN the camera SHALL smoothly follow the player movement

### Requirement 9

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the codebase to be well-structured with 3D capabilities and documented, so that it can be easily maintained and extended.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the project is structured THEN it SHALL separate concerns into player.js, obstacles.js, powers.js, game.js, scene.js, and utils.js files
2. WHEN code is written THEN each function SHALL include clear comments explaining its purpose
3. WHEN the project is delivered THEN it SHALL include Three.js integration for 3D rendering
4. WHEN the project is delivered THEN it SHALL include placeholder 3D models and textures
5. WHEN the project is delivered THEN it SHALL include a comprehensive README with setup instructions
6. WHEN the code runs THEN it SHALL achieve consistent 60fps performance in modern browsers using Three.js
7. WHEN 3D elements are rendered THEN they SHALL use efficient geometry and materials for optimal performance
